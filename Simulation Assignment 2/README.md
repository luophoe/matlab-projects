# Simulation Assignment 2
Q1. Using the information in example 9, in the set of notes titled “Roots of nonlinear equations”, 
find the temperature of an RTD that measure a resistance of: 55Ω and 260Ω.
- The program should be general and accept any resistance value. 
- The code should ask the user to input the resistance value.
- Use both bisection and Newton Raphson method. 
- The iterations should stop when the absolute relative approximate error percentage is less 
than or equal 0.05%.  

Q2. Create a code to solve a system of nonlinear equation using Newton Raphson method. The 
code should accept any acceptable initial condition, variables as symbolic variable and nonlinear 
equations. Use your program to solve the following non-linear equations from “Practice Questions 
4 – Question number 3:”
x3 – 10x + y – z +3 = 0
y3 + 10y – 2x – 2z – 5 = 0
x + y – 10 z + 2sin(z) + 5 = 0
